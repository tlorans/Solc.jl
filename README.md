# Solc.jl

Julia wrapper and version management tool for `solc` Solidity compiler.
Inspired by [`py-solc-x`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x/blob/master/README.md).

## Roadmap

At the moment, only the version management component is in work in progress state.
Once finalized, the wrapper component shoud be tackled.
